# ðŸŒ€ JSN flow  
**A powerful tool for visualizing the evolution of your project's configuration files over time.**

## ðŸš€ What is JSN flow

Modern software projects often rely heavily on structured configuration files â€” yet tracking changes to these configs is a nightmare. `JSN flow` solves that.

**JSN Flow** is a standalone desktop visualizer that lets you:
- Instantly see how your project config files evolve over time.
- Compare diffs between versions with a color-coded tree view.
- Track file history using a timeline-based UI.
- Navigate deeply nested keys with ease.
- Spot regressions and misconfigurations visually.
- Instantly roll back changes from ages ago

Whether you're debugging a bug introduced 3 versions ago or documenting a feature rollout, **JSN flow** gives you insight into your config timeline with surgical clarity.

Built entirely from scratch with **OpenGL**, native filesystem access, and zero runtime dependencies.
